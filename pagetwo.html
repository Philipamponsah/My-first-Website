      Text message-based health interventions
      Save this strategy
      Text message-based health interventions provide patients with reminders, education,
      or self-management assistance for a broad spectrum of health conditions.
      Interventions are most frequently used as a part of broader health promotion
      efforts or to help individuals manage <a href="http://www.google.com">chronic diseases1.</a>
      Text messages may be standardized or tailored to specific patients and sent at
      varied frequencies based on the intervention2. Text messaging can be combined with
      other approaches or delivered as part of a stepped care or progressive intervention
      that is tailored to patients’ needs, beginning with the least intensive treatment and
      moving to more intensive, and often expensive, treatments as needed1.
      Text message software and smartphone apps can be integrated into electronic health records (EHRs) to
      send alerts and reminders to patients3.

    <p>To ensure good health: eat lightly,
      breathe deeply, live moderately, cultivate cheerfulness,
      and maintain an interest in life. Nobody can be in good
       health if he does not have all the time fresh air,
       sunshine and good water.The only way to keep your health
        is to eat what you don’t want, drink what you don’t like,
        and do what you’d rather not.
