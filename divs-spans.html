  <h1>Divs and Spans (with classes!)</h1>

  <div class="top-section">
    <p class="intro">You will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated.
    The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling,
    <span class="highlight">but in rising every time</span> we fall.
    In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.
    Never let the <span class="highlight">fear of striking out keep you from playing the game</span>.
    Life is either a daring <strong>adventure</strong> or nothing at all.
    Many of life's failures are people who did not realize
    <span class="accent-color">how close they were to success</span> when they gave up.
    You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes.
    You can steer yourself any direction you choose. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-section">
    <p><span class="highlight">Spread love everywhere you go</span>. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.
    When you reach the end of your rope, tie a knot in it and hang on.
    Always remember that you are absolutely unique.
    Just like everyone else.
    <span class="accent-color">Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap</span> but by the seeds that you plant.
    The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
    Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.</p>
