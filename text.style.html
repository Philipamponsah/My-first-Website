<p> <span class="bold">Now read the Statement of Truth</span> through at least three times.
    In <a href="http://www.google.com">silence</a>, meditate on this thought for a few minutes.
    You can write the statement on a card and carry it with you.
    Read the Statement of <a href="#">Truth</a> and meditate on it as often as you can.
    Read the Statement of Truth just before you go to sleep,
    and go to sleep meditating on it.</p>

    <p>I find peace of mind through trusting God.
      I give over every anxious thought to the
      <a href="#">Perfect Power</a> within me knowing that this
      Power is <a href="#">all-knowing</a> and all-powerful.
      As I place my security in God,
      perfect right action is established in my life and affairs.</p>

      <p>I am not alone.
        The Infinite Love within me is all that I need.
         As I give this love forth to all mankind,
         it returns to me as perfect right companionship.
         The Love I give away I keep.Relax and be still for a few minutes.</p>
